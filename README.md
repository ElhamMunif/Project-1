# Project-1  Seattle AirBNB Data Analysis
This repository contains the the first project of  Udacity - Data Scientist - Analysing the Seattle Data for Airbnb.

# Motivation
This project was created as part of Udacity's Data Scientist nanodegree. Here I have analyzed Seattle Airbnb Open Data following CRISP-DM methodology. Airbnb data for other cities have the same format. So the same understandings and code can be applied to Airbnb dataset of any other city.

The business questions which I have tried to answer in this project are as follows:

Which properties is the most used in Seattle Airbnb?
What is the relation between price and property type?
What is the common Response Rate of the hosts? 
Most common price listings for AirBnb?
What is the common Properties Locations in Seattle Airbnb?
